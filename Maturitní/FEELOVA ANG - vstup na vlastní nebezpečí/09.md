* Today’s classroomsare filled with technology, from more common tools like interactive white boards to virtual reality devices. 
* In almost every class we can find a data projector which is a device that projects computer output onto a white or silver fabric screen that is wall, ceiling or tripod mounted. It is mostly used for slide presentations and displaying teaching materials.
* Most schools use special softwares for archiving pupil’s grades which usualy also have other functions built in (subject schedule, messages, homework).
In order to access those apps from school and be able to show teaching materials from the internet a lot of schools have their own wifi connection.
* Some schools evenimplement specific video games as learning tools in order to teach subjects like math or history. A good example is a popular video game called „Minecraft“ which helps with creativity, problem-solving, collaboration, etc.
Although there’s a lot of technology used, phones and other devices are usually prohibited during lessons.
