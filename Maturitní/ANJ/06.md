## P≈ô√≠klad ≈ôeƒçi:
* When it comes to food, technology isn't always the first thing that comes to mind. Nowadays however it's an important part of the food industry. Technology helps food manufacturers produce more efficiently for Earth‚Äôs growing population. There are more than 7 billion people in the world right now and the number is still growing which means higher demand for food each year. By using tech to improve processing and packing, it can improve the shelf life and safety of food.
* A refrigerator is a home appliance that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so which means that inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature. Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique in the developed countries. The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage. A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water. A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer. Their refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half.
* A microwave oven is an electric oven that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens are a common kitchen appliance and are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. They rapidly heat food that can easily burn if cooked in conventional pans, such as butter, fats, chocolate, or porridge. Microwave oven shaves a limited role in professional cooking because the boiling range temperature of a microwave oven will not produce the flavorful chemical reactions that frying or baking at a higher temperature will.
* A dishwasher is a machine for cleaning dishes automatically. Unlike manual dishwashing, which relies largely on physical scrubbing to remove soiling, the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water at the dishes. A mix of water and dishwasher detergent is pumped to one or more rotating spray arms, blasting the dishes with the cleaning mixture. The mixture is recirculated to save water and energy. Once the wash is finished, the water is drained, more hot water enters the tub and the sense cycles begin. When the rinsing is finished, the water is drained again and the dishes are dried using one of several drying methods. 
* The number of robots in the European food industry is well over 30,000. They help to ensure quality and affordability. By using machines, we can drive down the costs of keeping the food fresh. Robotic machines can also help to eliminate safety issues in the more dangerous food industry jobs. In 2016, a tech company rolled out a program for butchery. By using robots instead of people to cut the more difficult the meats they can save many work injuries. This is just one of the many ways technology can improve the industry.
* In the past few years, 3D printing has taken off across many industries and the food industry is one of them. There have been several applications of 3D printing food from NASA printing a pizza to creating soft foods for those who cannot chew. 
* To satisfy the increasing demand for food by the growing human population, cultured meat (also known as lab-grown meat) is presented as a good alternative for people who want to be more responsible but do not wish to change their diet. Cultured meat is made by painlessly harvesting muscle cells from a living animal and multiplying them to create muscle tissue, which is the main component of meat-eating. It is biologically the same as the meat tissue that comes from animals.
