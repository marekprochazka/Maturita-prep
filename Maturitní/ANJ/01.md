## Příklad řeči:     
* The first thing we need to deal with is type of phone. Bcs of constaly evolving technologies and features we should search for the simplest phone. The older push button phones are ideal but nowadays are not so much produced. I think that most cell phone stores have a phone section for seniors. These phones are usually solid and they are designed mainly for calling and writing messages.
* Then you should set up phone. Turn off some functions which are unnecessary for grandparents and would only confuse them. Mostly you turn off internet data or internet by itself (depends if grandparent will use internet). Additionally you can add sim card with credit and set up a few basic contacts, except contacts to family, you can also add contact for the their doctor, ambulance, police, etc.
* We start showing our grandparents control over the phone. How they can turn on/off phone, how the buttons work, sound settings, menu navigation to contacts etc. 
* Just like anywhere there are people that who want to abuse someone's ignorance. Grandparents are easy target for them. They can be easily scammed. These scam calles are usually masked by various actions of the interesting offer type but in reality is usually something cheap that is very expensive. It can be also some variety of services. We should tell our grandparents to be careful when calling with unknown numbers.
