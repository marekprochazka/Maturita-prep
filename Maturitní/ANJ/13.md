What is alternative energy? Which materials can be recycled and how can a person be environmentally friendly?

* What is alternative energy
* Sources (wind, solar, tidal)
* Recyclable materials
* How to be ecological

## Příklad řeči:
* Alternative energy = renewable energy – energy that is collected from renewable sources(sunlight,wind,rain,tides,waves)
* Alternative sources:
  * Wind energy - This is one of the cleanest and most accessible sources of energy
    * AD: Clean & Environment,Cost Effective,friendly Fuel source
    * DIS:Noise and aesthetic pollution
  * Solar energy - This is probably the most commonly known source of alternative energy
    * AD: Reduces Electricity Bills,Technology Development
    * DIS:Weather Dependent,Solar Energy Storage is Expensive
  * Tidal energy - This method of energy production is still fairly new and has only produced a small amount of energy so far, so it will be a long time before we see real results from tidal energy.
    * AD: Environment-friendly,A highly predictable energy source
    * DIS:High tidal power plant construction costs
* Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, batteries, and electronics
Being environmentally friendly simply means having a lifestyle that is better for the environment.
* A good way would be to start with conserving water, driving less and walking more, consuming less energy, buying recycled products, eating locally grown vegetables, joining environmental groups to combat air pollution, creating less waste, planting more trees, and many more.
