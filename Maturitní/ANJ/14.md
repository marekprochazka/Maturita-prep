## Příklad řeči:

- Radio - The antenna radiates the power in the current as radio waves. When the waves strike the antenna of a radio receiver, they push the electrons in the metal back and forth, inducing a tiny alternating current. The radio receiver connected to the receiving antenna detects this oscillating current and amplifies it.
	- Television - Television is really a three-part invention: the TV camera that turns a picture and sound into a signal; the TV transmitter that sends the signal through the air; and the TV receiver (the TV set in your home) that captures the signal and turns it back into picture and sound.
	- Internet – internet is only a bunch of PC’s wired together
		- thanks to that, they can share informations, in the course of time, there developed a lot of protocols and some like that stuff, to secure the communication, or make in easier. The Internet has one very simple job: to move computerized information (known as data) from one place to another. That's it! The machines that make up the Internet treat all the information they handle in exactly the same way. In this respect, the Internet works a bit like the postal service.
		- interesting fact about internet communication – thanks to the internet, it’s hard for distator regimes to stay att power, because there are wals how to stay anonymous on the internet (VPN relatively, Dark web, specialized applications with end-to-end encryption…)
