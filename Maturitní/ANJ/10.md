## Příklad řeči:
* Today I’m going to explain to you what it means when someone is working as a programmer.
* But what is programming? Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. We can do that in many programming languages, for example, JavaScript, Python, C#, C++ and so on. It’s used to automate nearly everything we use in our daily lives. We have calculators, vacuum cleaner robots and even self-driving cars.
* You might say: “You have to study your whole life to be as good as these programmers”, but you don’t. Nowadays you can learn programming from the comfort of your home. You start with some basic printing strings and integers, some mathematical equations and first cycles. If you understand these basics you can upgrade to importing libraries and trying new stuff as printing graphs, making windows for your program or hashing your passwords.
