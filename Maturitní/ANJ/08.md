### Specific task:
Explain how the car market is changing with the introduction of new fuel alternatives. 

* fuel alternatives (hydrogen, electricity, diesel, ethanol)
* market (demand of customers vs demand of "goverments")

## Příklad řeči:
* fuel alternatives for cars:
	* Hydrogen - abundant in our environment and therefore greatly accessible
	* Electricity - releases zero emissions, cheaper fuel, great acceleration
	* Biodiesel - has less energy content(biodiesel-powered vehicles require more fuel than standard diesel cars)
	* Ethanol - producing is energy-intensive, vehicles run fewer km per litre than if it was 100% gasoline-powered

* The car market is changing to meet customers demand, otherwise it would be useless to produce cars which customers would not use.
for example, if a lot of people would want to have an electric car, then there would be more eletric cars in car market and it would probably be cheaper and more accessible for electric cars because customers would because thats what customers would want and what they would pay for.
