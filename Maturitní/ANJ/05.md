Shopping is necessary activity nowadays. We need to shop for food, clothes, gadgets, services and so on. For some people, shopping is even more than just a necessary activity. Someone can do shopping as a hobby or even can have a source of income from shopping and reselling stuff. 

When it comes to shopping in person, there are two types of people. The first group prefers to visit large shopping centers where they have everything in one place. In shopping centers is usually a supermarket and many specialized shops. The drawback for shopping centers being so practical and compact is the big concentration of people, especially in busy hours. The second group prefers to visit single specialized shops or supermarkets outside the shopping centers. 

A big topic nowadays is online shopping. We live in times when we can purchase online utterly everything. From clothes, through food to even cars or real estate. It is good to say that many things are still better to buy in person, such as clothes because you can try them on but on the other hand on the internet is a larger selection of clothes from which to choose. 

Smart people are trying to find ways to save money while shopping. The first and most obvious way to save is to buy just necessary things. Another way is to look for sales. The last way which I remember is to use some kind of cashback services. 


### Specific tast:
How to secure the proces of payment?

Osnova: 
* Ways user can secure payment
* Ways developers of an app can secure payment
* How I pay on the internet
* Cryptocurrency 


### Příklad řeči:
* As a user. The most important part of securing payments is to not pay on unverified pages. It is also important to keep sensitive information safe like for example card PIN code. Another important part of a user’s safety paying is using the two-phase verification which will rapidly increase the security of payments. 
* There is also an importance of well-done job by developers of certain service especially on the security of saving the user’s data. It is very hard to create a functional and safe payment gateway that would be approved by the necessary authorities. That’s why most of the developers cooperate with some third-party service that is specialized in payments and is already approved.  
* When I pay on the internet I usually use a service called Google pay, which has saved my card information or I use my card by itself. I use two-phase verification which means, that except for writing card information, or just clicking on a card in Google pay I also have to write a code from SMS or confirm payment in the banking app.
* Another new and very interesting way to secure payments is to use modern cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Bitcoin is especially powerful when we would like to stay anonymous. Thanks to blockchain technology that saves data of all transactions bitcoin can’t be stolen if an owner behaves responsibly.
