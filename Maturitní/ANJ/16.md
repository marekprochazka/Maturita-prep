## Příklad řeči:
Olomouc is a city in the east of the Czech Republic. It has about 100,000 inhabitants, and its larger urban zone has a population of about 390,000 inhabitants.

Located on the Morava River, the city is the ecclesiastical metropolis and was a historical capital city of Moravia, before having been sacked by the Swedish army during the Thirty Years' War. Today, it is the administrative center of the Olomouc Region and the sixth-largest city in the Czech Republic. The historic city center is valuable and well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation. The Holy Trinity Column is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Public transport in Olomouc is provided by trams and buses. Local railway services from Olomouc main railway station to Senice na Hané and Prostějov make stops around the city.

The main railway station in Olomouc (Olomouc hlavní nádraží) is an important railway junction. The city is connected with Prague, Ostrava, Brno, Zlín and Břeclav. The main train station in Olomouc is quite busy and filled with passenger trains of all categories operated by Czech Railways, RegioJet, and LEO Express make stops there. Tram station and many bus stations are part of the main train station too. 

My school is located only around 5 minutes away from the main train station and 2 minutes from the nearest tram station Vejdovského. 

What I really like about Olomouc is its compactness. It's easy to get anywhere just by your legs. For example, when I was in a pub and now I want to go home I don't need to call a cab to pick me up. From the center I'm home in less than 30 minutes even tho I'm living in a suburb of the city. I know sometimes you don't have time to take a walk. During rush hours can be a good idea to take a bike ride. The city is filled with paths for cyclists so you don't even ride with the cars. Some of the parks are going through beautiful parks that are located near the city center. 

In your free time, you can choose from many varieties of activities. You can visit one of the restaurants or pubs in the center, you can visit some sports events like football, handball or hockey. You can go for a walk in the city's parks or even go to the cinema or theatre.
