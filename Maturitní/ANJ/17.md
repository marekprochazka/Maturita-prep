He was a mathematician, physicist, astronomer, and alchemist. He was best known for the “eureka” moment when he saw an apple fall from a tree that inspired his most-celebrated work Principia. In Principia, he formulated the laws of motion and described universal gravitation which is still relevant and used in basic research today. He also formulated his theory of color, which attributed color as a property of light, and invented the first telescope. 

### Charles Darwin - (1809-1882) 
He was a naturalist, geologist, and biologist. His best-known work was the book On the Origin of the Species that describes his theory of evolution. On his five-year voyage on the HMS Beagle, he worked on his nowadays reputable theory of coral islands - atolls.
