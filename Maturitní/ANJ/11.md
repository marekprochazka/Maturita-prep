Our contemporary world is very different in comparison with the world one hundred years ago and it’s becoming more and more complicated. Texhnologies are evolving faster and faster and some people may find it difficult to adapt to the changes. Especially young people struggle, because they have to learn and grow in a very different world than they parents and teachers. Never in history was generation gap that visible. Teenagers have to learn by themselfs how finances and banking accounts work, how to use telephones, computers and how to orient in todays rushed world.

For many of them this may be stressful. Then it depends on each one of them, how they will handle these factors. Somebody will go to gym to supress psychical pain with physical, somebody will fall for drugs.

Drugs are problem all over the world. Most of them are illegal, but that doesn’t stops drug cartels, as drug trafficking remains the sekond biggest business in the world. Only military business is bigger.

Drugs can be dividend into three groups, which all can be harming for their user. First are hard drugs, these include cocaine, heroin, pervitin for the most known. Hard drugs are the most dangerous. Why people use them? Well these drugs are the most efficient in changing moods and making their users feel confident, strong, independent or relaxed. But they are highly addictive and can quickly destroy human organism. They are all illegal, so they are very expensive. They users usually cannot focus on anything else than another shot, so they often lose jo band are forced to steal. There is also risk of serious ilnesses like AIDS or hepatitis.
Second group are soft drugs. Here we can count mariujana or solvents. These drugs aren‘t so addictive or destructive, but are still illegal, but it’s not that hard to purchase them.

There i salso group of legal drugs, like alkohol and Tobago. These drugs can be bought in normal supermarkets, but can be bought only by person older than 18 (in Czech republic). States are trying to limit consumption of these drugs by high taxes, but these taxes are also reason, why are not these drugs banned, because they make huge money on these taxes.

Drugs are not the only problem of today world. There are some diseases known as civillization diseases. Here we can count AIDS, HIV, obesity, diabetes, heart diseases and more others.

Unemployment is a serious problem in every country. In Czechia is not as big problem as in other countries, in fact we have one of best unemployment rate in EU. Unemployment can be caused by closing some industries, like coal mines in Ostrava. Lots of companies goes bankrupt, so more people find themselfs without income. In CZ we have some support in unemployment, but i tis enough only for cover of basic life needs. There i also psychical factor od being unemployment, because some people can find it humiliating, not be able to take care of themselfs.

Another problem are childrens, who have too busy parents to look after them. These parents usually try to compensate it by giving thein children money. But this can buid bad habbit in these children, because they are used to have enough money, so they may not be able to take proper care of thein finances while adults.
Recent problems, that was happening in 2014-2019 mainly, are migration and internationa terrorism. These problems are mainly caused by unstable situatin in Africa and Middle East. Terrorism is now a little less problem since „descruction“ of ISIS in Syria.

Fake news are a new serious problem, which widespread with boom of internet, because internet is a free medium, where anyone can post practically everything. So it’s harder than ever to obtain right and true informations, because of existence of many conspiracy webs and other untrustworthy mediums. But it can be problem even for TVs like ČT. This can cause problems for older generatin, because they are used from older days to trust TV in everything.

Poverty is unability of having choices and it‘s serious problem in practically every country, because of many reasons. The most serious is this problem in Africa and other 3rd world countries. Here is often ocasion to live under 10 US dollars per day. In Europe is also poverty, but in other way. We are able to help each other through social programs governed by state.



### Special task:
What problems of contemporary society are caused by modern technologies? How does technology affect labour market? What benefits do the technologies bring to people in the branches of health care or education?

* problems in society caused by modern technologies
* affect on labour market
* positives in education
* positives in healthcare

## Příklad řeči: 
Modern technology and inventions brings us lots of benefits, but also some negatives. For example social networks are great for instant communication and sparing some moments with your loved ones, but they are also perfect tool for cyberbullying, because on the internet and these platforms, you can choose every possible nickname and practically stay in absolute anonymity. This oportunity makes cyberbullying much easier, because if you stay anonymous, you cannot be punished.

Another problem is the generation gap. Today‘s kids are growing in a wastly different world, than their parents. This means they understand internet and social networks much better than parents, who most time doesn’t care what their child is doing on the mobile. This can lead to some pretty bad situations (V síti for example).

Technology also affected labour market. It created a whole new labour markets like electrotechnology, IT and changed practically everything else. This can lead to some robotization in factories and redundacies (propouštění). But, as i said, hen these positions closed, many new opened in controlling these machines atd.

New technologies also changed the way of learning at school. Newly was addend some PC lessons, many schools are adding new dataprojectors or TVs to make learning and teaching more flexible. Another advantage is in availability of information. In the past, we had to go to library to find some useful information, today we only must have connection to the internet and some device, most PC or laptop and we can find everything.

In healthcare we started using a lot of new technologies to make it far more better. We are using for example x-ray, ultrasound, lasers for cancer curing and skin or eye operations and newly we are starting to experiment with robotic surgery, which seems to be better for patient in extra precious operations, where are human hands just too big, like brain operations.
