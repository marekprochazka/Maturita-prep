### Specific task:
Many of presents need a battery to be run. What types of cells do you know? 

Příklad řeči: 

I would like to talk about the 5 most common battery types of cels I know. These types are 
AAA, AA, Type C, coin, and cel. 
<br>
The most common and popular batteries on the market are the AAA batteries. 
These batteries can be used in smaller devices such as remote controllers, very small toys, or clocks.
Another pretty common battery type is the AA. The AA batteries are bigger than the AAA batteries from which it follows they can power larger devices like different types of remote controllers, 
toys, or small electronics
Type C batteries are also somehow used in some presents such as bigger toys or bigger lamps. Batteries of this type are not that common, 
because they are pretty large.
Last but not least are the cell or coin batteries. These batteries are very small so it follows that these battery types are used in small gifts like hand watches
