### Specific task:
Many of presents need a battery to be run. What types of cells do you know? 

* AAA
* AA
* C
* Cell/coin batteries
* special types
  
## Příklad řeči: 
* The most common and popular batteries on the marker are the AAA batteries. These batteries can be used in smaller devices such as remote controllers, very small toys, or clocks.
* Another pretty common battery type is the AA. The AA batteries are bigger than the AAA batteries from which it follows they can power larger devices like different types of remote controllers, toys, or small electronics
* Type C batteries are also somehow used in some presents such as bigger toys or bigger lamps. Batteries of this type are not that common, because they are pretty large.
* Last but not least are the cell or coin batteries. These batteries are very small so it follows that these battery types are used in small gifts like hand watches
* special rechargable bateries:
	* car batteries
	* mobile batteries
    * li-ion - smaller appliances
